## UI/UX
## Project goals

The website's user interface (UX) was designed with simplicity in mind. The app is fully functional on all screen sizes, including 1400px, 1200px, 992px, 768px, and 576px, with comprehensive examination for each functionality.


The goal of this assignment is to create a web interface that allows users to simply store and access and performance the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) actions. This project's goal is to allow users to create, store, modify, and remove posts (CRUD).

Users can create new categories, which greatly expands the reach of the blog's conversation topics.
